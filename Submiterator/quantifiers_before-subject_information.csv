74,Male,"I spent quite a bit of time teaching my daughter to read with Hooked On Phonics and I learned that they can answer questions in different ways. I think as grown ups we expect what we know to be obvious in sometimes, a one word answer. Some of these examples reminded me of that. I can't remember exactly but it goes something like which flower was not picked? Say for instance, the adult knew the answer to be one word, green. But the child reasons, x did not pick red, y did not pick yellow and z did not pick blue. The child is saying the green flower was not picked but in a round about way, I believe.",2,23,Yes,English,2
